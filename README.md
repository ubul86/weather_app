# Weather App

## Overview

This project is a weather application that provides real-time weather information using a Laravel 10 backend API and a Vue.js frontend. 
The backend communicates with an external weather API service, processes the data using Laravel Queue Jobs, and broadcasts the weather updates to the frontend via WebSocket events. 

The frontend is built with Vue.js 2, Vuetify, and Vuex, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Laravel 10 Backend:**
    - Fetches weather data from an external API based on the user's location.
    - Processes weather data asynchronously using Laravel Queue Jobs.
    - Broadcasts weather updates to the frontend via WebSocket events using Laravel Echo.
    - Provides RESTful API endpoints to fetch weather data for specific cities.

- **Vue.js 2 Frontend:**
    - Built with Vue.js 2, Vuetify (for UI components), and Vuex (for state management).
    - Displays real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
    - Automatically updates the UI with the latest weather data using WebSocket connections.

- **Dockerized Services:**
    - The application runs in a Dockerized environment for consistency and ease of deployment.
    - Includes services for Nginx, PHP, MySQL, Redis, Soketi, Node.js, and phpMyAdmin.

- **Testing & Code Quality:**
    - Includes a suite of unit and feature tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.
    - Adheres to best practices in coding standards and formatting, ensuring maintainability and readability.

## Minimum Requirements

- **Docker and Docker Compose**
- **PHP**: 8.1 or higher
- **Composer**: 2.0 or higher
- **MySQL**: 5.7 or higher
- **Laravel**: 10.x
- **Node.js 16** or higher

## Docker Services

This project uses Docker to containerize the different components of the application. Below is a description of each service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

- **soketi**: This service runs a lightweight WebSocket server (using Soketi) that acts as a drop-in replacement for Pusher. It is responsible for handling real-time event broadcasting between the backend and frontend.

- **nginx**: The Nginx service serves as a reverse proxy for the application, routing HTTP requests to the appropriate backend services.

- **php**: This service runs the PHP application (Laravel) using PHP 8.1. It is the core backend service that handles HTTP requests, interacts with the database, and manages the application logic. The service shares the application codebase with the host machine to enable hot-reloading during development.

- **php-cli-cron**: A PHP service dedicated to running scheduled tasks (cron jobs) within the Laravel application. It ensures that background tasks such as data processing and queue workers are executed at the specified intervals.

- **redis**: The Redis service is used as an in-memory data store and cache. It is essential for handling queues, caching frequently accessed data, and storing real-time event data.

- **mysql**: This service runs the MySQL database server, which stores the application's data. The database is configured with persistent storage to retain data across container restarts. The database credentials and other environment variables are defined in the `.env` file.

- **phpmyadmin**: A web-based interface for managing MySQL databases. It allows developers to interact with the database, run queries, and manage tables via a user-friendly UI. The service is accessible via a browser on port 80 (or a custom port defined in the `.env` file).

- **node**: This service is responsible for building and serving the Vue.js frontend application. It runs the Node.js server, compiles assets, and serves the frontend during development.


## Installation With Docker

First, need a fresh installation of Docker and Docker Compose

### 1. Clone the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://ubul86@bitbucket.org/ubul86/weather_app.git
cd weather_app
```
 
### 2. Copy Environment File

Copy the .env.sample file to .env:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In the .env file, you need to set the DB connections and some Host, Pusher and Queue value.
Here is an example configuration:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_database_root_password

BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher

QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379

PUSHER_APP_ID=dklsjdskljflkt9849jkldsj
PUSHER_APP_KEY=fdsjkgklriut9itoskl
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=dsfkjhdsjkgflkdgfbhgduh43
PUSHER_HOST=soketi
PUSHER_PORT=6001
PUSHER_SCHEME=http
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1

NGINX_PORT=8080
PHPMYADMIN_PORT=45678
VITE_API_URL=/api/

```

The DB_HOST needs to be mysql container name and the PUSHER_HOST needs to be soketi like in docker-compose.yml service name.

### 4. Build The Containers

Go to the project root directory, where is the docker-compose.yml file and add the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 5. Install Dependencies:

Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container_name} composer install
```

or
```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container_name} bash
composer install
```

### 6. Generate JWT Secret

Generate the JWT secret key:

```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container_name} php artisan jwt:secret
```

or

```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container_name} bash
php artisan jwt:secret
```

### 7. Run Migrations

Run the database migrations:

```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container_name} php artisan migrate
```

or

```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container_name} bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 8. Seed the Database

Seed the database with initial data:

```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container_name} php artisan db:seed
```

or

```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container_name} bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### 9. Build or Watch the frontend

```bash
docker exec -it {node_container_name} npm run build
```

or

```bash
docker exec -it {node_container_name} npm run watch
```


## Installation Without Docker

This command will update the .env file with the JWT_SECRET key.

### 5. Configure the Database

Create a new database for the project and set the database connection in the .env file. Update the following lines in your .env file. There is an example setting:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username

### 9. Build or Watch the Frontend With Vite

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
npm run watch
```

### 10. Start the Websocket

## Testing and Analysis Tools

### PHP CodeSniffer (PHPCS)

PHPCS is used to check coding standards and style violations.

```bash
composer lint
```

or

```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container} composer lint
```

### PHPStan

PHPStan is used for static code analysis to find bugs and improve code quality.

Run PHPStan:

```bash
composer analyse
```

or 

```bash
docker exec -it {php_fpm_container} composer analyse
```

Note: You might need to update your phpstan.neon configuration if you encounter issues or deprecations.

## Running Tests

### PHPUnit

Unit tests are written using PHPUnit. To run tests, first configure SQLite in-memory database in phpunit.xml. This setup allows you to run tests without affecting your actual database. The database is created and discarded during each test run, ensuring a clean state.

- Open phpunit.xml and set up the SQLite in-memory database configuration:
```xml
<phpunit bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php" colors="true">
    <php>
        <env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
        <env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
    </php>
</phpunit>
```

- Run the tests:
```bash
php artisan test
```

This will execute all tests in the tests directory and provide a summary of test results.
